A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
The application should consist of three main pages: Product Listing Page, Cart Page, and Wishlist Page.
Create a dummy data of a product lists .
Users should be able to add products to their cart from this page.
When a product is added to the cart, the cart count should increase.
Implement functionality to increment and decrement the count of products once they click on the add button on product.
Display the current count of items in the cart.
